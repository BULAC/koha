This is BULAC Koha, a 3.02.04 community version with a lot of
customizations (one man-year developpement). This fork is a dead end
brought here for history.

The BULAC is curently porting all those customizations on a recent
Koha version. Our goal is to keep ourselves close to the community
version and facilitate reuse of our code.
