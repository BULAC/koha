=head1 NAME

C4::Desks - Desk management functions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains an API for manipulating issue desks in Koha. It
is used by circulation.

=head1 HISTORICAL NOTE

Developped by Progilone on a customised Koha 3.2 for BULAC
library. The module is ported to Koha 3.19 and up by the BULAC.

=head2 AddDesk

  AddDesk({
    'deskcode'        => $deskcode,
    'deskname'        => $deskname,
    'deskdescription' => $deskdescription
    'branchcode'      => $branchcode });

  returns 1 on success, undef on error. A return value greater than 1
  or just -1 means something went wrong.

sub AddDesk {
    my ($args) = @_;
    C4::Context->dbh->do
	    ('INSERT INTO desks ' .
	     '(deskcode, deskname, deskdescription, branchcode) ' .
	     'VALUES (?,?,?,?)' ,

	     $args->{'deskname'},
	     $args->{'deskdescription'},
	     $args->{'branchcode'},
	    );
}

=head2 DelDesk

  DelDesk($deskcode)

  returns 1 on success, undef on error. A return value greater than 1
  or just -1 means something went wrong.

=cut

    my $deskcode = shift;
    C4::Context->dbh->do

	     undef,
	     $deskcode
	    );
}

=head2 GetDesk

  $desk_href = GetDesk($deskcode);

  returns undef when no desk matches $deskcode, return a href
  containing desk parameters:
    {'deskcode' => $deskcode,
     'deskname' => $deskname,
     'deskdescription' => $deskdescription,
     'branchcode' => $branchcode }

    $sth->execute($deskcode);
    $sth->fetchrow_hashref;
}

=head2 GetDesks

    $desk_aref = GetDesks([$branch])

    returns an array ref containing deskcodes. If no desks are
    available, the array is empty.

    my $branchcode   = shift || '';
    my $retaref = [];

       'deskdescription' => $deskdescription,
       'branchcode' => $branchcode
    }
    ModDesks($deskhref)

    Modify desk with $deskcode with values contained in various
    $deskhref fields. Returns 1 on success, 0 if no desk were
    modified, undef, -1 or an int greater than 1 if something went
    terribly wrong.
